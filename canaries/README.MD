**Canaries**

Canaries were used as a form of low tech danger warning signal in the early days of mining. In a similar fashion, we can create and monitor low tech "canaries" within our technology environment to signal when bad activities may be occuring and we need to react. 

This talk reviews various forms of "canaries" that can be implemented across the environment at no or low cost to raise the alarm on activities that should not normally be occurring. Signals from these canaries occur early in the MITRE kill chain providing time for teams to implement counter measures and prevent further intrusion. Understanding detection is a must for stopping an attack, the concepts presented will help initiate the process of triggering alerts for when action must be taken.
