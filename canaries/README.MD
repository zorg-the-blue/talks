Canaries

Canaries were used as a form of low tech warning in the early days of mining. In a similar fashion, we can create and monitor low tech "canaries" within our technology environment to signal when bad activities may be occuring and we need to react. 

This talk reviews various forms of "canaries" that can be implemented at no or low cost to raise the alarm on activities that should not normally be occurring within the environment. Signals from these canaries occur early in the MITRE kill chain providing time for teams to implement counter measures and prevent further intrusion.
